# Windows-Use Information

## Summary

## Structure
- **windows_use/**: Main package directory
  - **agent/**: Core agent implementation with tools, registry, and prompt handling
  - **desktop/**: Desktop interaction functionality
  - **tree/**: UI element tree navigation and manipulation

## Implementation History

### 2025-01-11 — V1 Smart Instructions Generator
- **What changed**: Added TaskAnalyzer to generate specific instructions using Qwen 72B, feeding into Windows-Use agent with Gemini Flash Lite
- **Files**: Created new mainv1.py (working version), test_v1.py for validation
- **Models**: Qwen 72B for analysis (~$0.001), Gemini Flash Lite for execution (~$0.003)
- **Result**: Successfully generated clear, specific instructions for all test cases:
  - "Open Notepad and type Hello World" → 6 precise instructions
  - "Open Chrome and go to google.com" → 7 step-by-step actions
  - "Open Settings and search for display" → 7 specific UI steps
- **Cost**: ~$0.004 per task
- **Key Learning**: Windows-Use works better with goals rather than detailed step-by-step instructions. Revised approach focuses on WHAT to do, not HOW to click.

### 2025-01-11 — V2 Multi-Stage Execution [IN PROGRESS - NOT YET SUCCESSFUL]
- **What changed**: Attempting to add MultiStageAgent that breaks complex tasks into goal-oriented stages, each executed independently
- **Files**: mainv2.py (in development), test_v2.py for validation (planned)
- **Models**: Qwen 72B for task decomposition (~$0.001), Gemini Flash Lite for stage execution (~$0.003 per stage)
- **Architecture**: Task Decomposer → Stage Executor → Stage Validator → Combined Results
- **Current Challenges**:
  - Stage coordination complexity higher than anticipated
  - Difficulty in programmatic validation of stage completion
  - Balancing goal-oriented vs step-by-step instructions per stage
  - State management between stages needs refinement
- **Key Learnings So Far**:
  - Windows-Use works best with atomic, focused goals per stage
  - Complex multi-step coordination within a single stage causes conflicts
  - Each stage requires clear, verifiable success criteria
  - Stage transitions need more sophisticated error handling
- **Status**: Implementation in progress, requires further refinement before success

### 2025-01-11 — V2.1 Enhanced Multi-Stage Execution [IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE]
- **What changed**: Created enhanced multi-stage agent addressing V2 challenges with improved error handling, state management, and validation
- **Files**: mainv21.py (enhanced implementation), test_v21.py for validation
- **Models**: Qwen 72B for task decomposition (~$0.001), Gemini Flash Lite for execution (~$0.003 per stage), Gemini Flash Lite for validation (~$0.001)
- **Architecture**: Enhanced Task Decomposer → Stage Executor with Retry → Intelligent Validator → State-Aware Results
- **Key Improvements**:
  - Better Windows COM error handling and recovery
  - Context preservation and state management between stages
  - More intelligent and flexible validation (practical vs strict)
  - Retry mechanisms for failed stages with exponential backoff
  - Enhanced stage goal construction with accumulated context
  - Improved logging and debugging information
- **Technical Enhancements**:
  - StageResult dataclass for better result tracking
  - Accumulated context passing between stages
  - Fallback validation when JSON parsing fails
  - Enhanced error handling with try/catch and graceful degradation
  - Success rate calculation and overall task status
- **Model Compatibility Note**: GPT OSS 120B attempted but incompatible with Windows-Use action format. Gemini Flash Lite provides better compatibility with Windows-Use's expected XML/structured response format.
- **Status**: Implementation complete, ready for testing
- **Next**: Test V2.1 extensively, then proceed to V3 adaptive model selection
