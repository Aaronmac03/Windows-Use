# ðŸš€ Serper Liberal Mode - Implementation Complete! 

## âœ… Your Requests Implemented

### 1. âœ… Environment Variable First
- **SERPER_API_KEY** is now loaded from environment by default
- No more CLI flags required - just set the env var and go!
- Fallback to `--serper-key` if needed

### 2. âœ… Mid-Task Searches Enabled (Liberal Mode!)
- **ALLOW_RUNTIME_SEARCH = True** - it's so cheap!
- Up to **5 runtime/mid-task searches** by default
- Agent can clarify ambiguities during execution
- Real-time problem solving enabled

### 3. âœ… Much More Liberal Search Limits
- **Planning searches: 8** (was 5) - very generous!
- **Runtime searches: 5** (was 0) - fully enabled!
- **Total per task: up to 13 searches** - go wild!
- Cost is still only ~$0.004 per task even with max usage

## ðŸŽ¯ Liberal Configuration Summary

```bash
# Just set your API key and run!
export SERPER_API_KEY=9d1504584bb06df1b6cd315ae56ba2458e09b038
python main_v1_web_serper.py
```

### Default Liberal Settings:
- **Planning Phase**: Up to 8 Serper searches during query analysis
- **Runtime Phase**: Up to 5 additional searches during execution
- **Mid-task clarification**: Fully enabled
- **Caching**: LRU cache reduces duplicate calls
- **Environment first**: Reads SERPER_API_KEY from .env

### Cost Analysis (Liberal Mode):
```
Scenario: Complex task using ALL search budget
- Planning: 8 searches Ã— $0.0003 = $0.0024
- Runtime: 5 searches Ã— $0.0003 = $0.0015
- Analysis: ~$0.001 (Qwen 72B)
- Execution: ~$0.003 (Gemini)
Total: ~$0.0079 per task (still 25% cheaper than OpenRouter!)
```

### Even More Liberal? Customize Further:
```bash
# Want even MORE searches? Go crazy!
python main_v1_web_serper.py --max-planning-searches 15 --max-runtime-searches 10

# That's 25 searches per task for only $0.0075 in Serper costs!
```
