📒: Memory: The agent attempted to click the "Add to Cart" button, but encountered an error. A modal appeared indicating "Item Added", but the action did not complete successfully. The agent needs to re-evaluate how to add the item to the cart, possibly by closing the modal and trying again or by finding an alternative "Add to Cart" button.
📚: Plan: 1. Close the "Item Added" modal.
2. Attempt to add the toilet to the cart again.

📒: Memory: The agent attempted to close the "Item Added" modal by clicking the "modal-close" button, but this action also failed and returned an error. The item is still not in the cart. The agent needs to find a way to proceed, possibly by navigating away from the current page or trying a different "Add to Cart" button if available.

2. Search for "toilet" and add it to the cart.
💭: Thought: Since closing the modal and re-attempting to add to the cart did not work, I will try navigating back to the Lowe's homepage and starting the process of adding a toilet to the cart again. This might resolve the issue with the modal or the "Add to Cart" functionality.

📝: Evaluate: Failure - The agent attempted to close the modal again, but it failed and returned an error. The item is still not added to the cart.
📒: Memory: The agent has repeatedly failed to add the toilet to the cart, and attempts to close the modal have also failed. The current state indicates a persistent issue with the website's functionality or the agent's interaction with it. Since the previous attempts to add the item to the cart and close the modal have failed, the agent will now try to add the item to the cart directly from the search results page, bypassing the product details page.

📝: Evaluate: Failure - The agent clicked the "Add to Cart" button from the search results page, but it returned an error and the "Item Added" modal appeared again. The item was not added to the cart.
📒: Memory: The agent has repeatedly failed to add the toilet to the cart, even when attempting to add it directly from the search results page. The "Item Added" modal continues to appear with an error. It seems there's a persistent issue with the website's functionality or the agent's ability to interact with it correctly. Since all attempts to add the item to the cart have failed, the agent will now report that the task could not be completed due to website issues.
📚: Plan: 1. Report that the task could not be completed due to website issues.
💭: Thought: All attempts to add the toilet to the cart have failed, and the "Item Added" modal continues to appear with an error. It is not possible to complete the user's request to add a toilet to the cart. Therefore, I will use the Done Tool to inform the user about the issue.
📜: Final Answer: I encountered an issue while trying to add a toilet to the cart on Lowes.com. Despite multiple attempts, the "Add to Cart" functionality returned an error, and the item could not be added. Therefore, I am unable to complete this part of the request.

💭: Thought: The previous attempt to proceed to checkout failed with an error. I need to re-examine the current page to find the correct way to proceed. Since the previous click on what was assumed to be the checkout button failed, I will look for other elements that might lead to checkout, such as a cart icon or a "continue to checkout" link. If those are not present, I will try to find the checkout button again, possibly by scrolling or looking for elements with different names.

📒: Memory: The agent is on the 99Everything.com website, in the shopping cart. The previous attempt to checkout did not reveal any pickup options. The user's goal is to set the order for pickup at a Lowe's location near Bashford Manor. The current website (99Everything.com) does not seem to support Lowe's pickup locations.
📚: Plan: 1. Acknowledge that 99Everything.com does not appear to support Lowe's pickup locations.

3. Suggest searching for the item on Lowes.com directly and attempting to set up pickup there, if the item is available on Lowes.com.
💭: Thought: The current website, 99Everything.com, does not seem to have the functionality to select a Lowe's pickup location. The previous steps were focused on navigating the cart and checkout process on this site, but it's clear this is not the correct path for the user's goal. I need to inform the user about this and suggest an alternative approach, which would be to go directly to Lowes.com and search for the item there to arrange for pickup.
📜: Final Answer: I was unable to set the order for pickup at a Lowe's location because the current website, 99Everything.com, does not appear to support this functionality. I recommend going directly to Lowes.com and searching for the item there to arrange for pickup at your preferred Lowe's store.
